    <h1>Introduction to css</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and format HTML content on web pages. It allows you to control the appearance of elements, including their layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. By separating the content (HTML) from the design (CSS), it becomes easier to maintain and update the look of a website. CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and applies rules that define how those elements should be displayed. For example, you can use CSS to change the background color of a page, adjust the size of text, or position elements precisely on the screen.</p>

    <p class="cars">Cars are vehicles designed for transporting people or goods on roads. They typically have four wheels and are powered by internal combustion engines or electric motors. Cars come in various types, including sedans, SUVs, trucks, and sports cars. They offer convenience, speed, and comfort, making them a popular mode of transportation worldwide. Advances in technology have led to the development of electric cars, hybrid models, and self-driving vehicles, improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact.</p>
